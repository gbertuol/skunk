/**
 * Command-completed response. The command tag is usually a single word that identifies which SQL
 * command was completed.
 *
 * - For an INSERT command, the tag is `INSERT <oid> <rows>`, where rows is the number of rows inserted.
 *   oid is the object ID of the inserted row if rows is 1 and the target table has OIDs; otherwise
 *   oid is 0.
 * - For a DELETE command, the tag is DELETE rows where rows is the number of rows deleted.
 * - For an UPDATE command, the tag is UPDATE rows where rows is the number of rows updated.
 * - For a SELECT or CREATE TABLE AS command, the tag is SELECT rows where rows is the number of
 *   rows retrieved.
 * - For a MOVE command, the tag is MOVE rows where rows is the number of rows the cursor's position
 *   has been changed by.
 * - For a FETCH command, the tag is FETCH rows where rows is the number of rows that have been
 *   retrieved from the cursor.
 * - For a COPY command, the tag is COPY rows where rows is the number of rows copied. (Note: the
 *   row count appears only in PostgreSQL 8.2 and later.)
 *
 * @param completion The command tag.
